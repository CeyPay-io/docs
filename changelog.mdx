## 🎉 Merchant static QRs are live on CeyPay

<Frame>![Merchant Static QR](/images/assets/changelog/merchant-qr.webp)</Frame>

Merchants can now easily receive instant payments with just a QR code. These QRs enable seamless in-store transactions or remote payments when shared digitally, allowing customers to pay from anywhere at any time.

## 🎉 Branches are live on CeyPay

<Frame>![CeyPay Branches Feature](/images/branch.png)</Frame>

Manage multiple locations with independent payment tracking and reporting.

Merchants can now create branches with optional separate bank accounts for their organizations. Each branch operates as an isolated entity where all resources—payment links, payments, and analytics—are attached to that specific branch.

- **Multiple Branches**: Create branches for different locations or business units
- **Separate Bank Accounts**: Optionally configure different settlement accounts per branch
- **User Management**: Add users and managers under specific branches
- **Isolated Resources**: Payment links and payments are tracked per branch
- **Branch-Level Reporting**: Track and report on each branch independently
- **Centralized Dashboard**: Manage all branches from a single merchant account

Perfect for multi-location businesses, franchises, and organizations that need location-based payment tracking and settlement.
