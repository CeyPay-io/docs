## Do I need any special devices?

No. You can accept payments using a QR code, payment link, or a free POS device if eligible.

## Can I offer refunds?

Crypto payments are instant and final. Once a payment is completed on-chain, it cannot be reversed or double-spent. This means there are virtually no chargebacks, with over 99.9% of transactions being final. If a merchant chooses to issue a refund, it can be handled manually off-chain or through settlement adjustments, based on mutual agreement with the customer. This model significantly reduces fraud, disputes, and chargeback risk compared to traditional card payments.

## Can online stores use CeyPay?

Yes. At the moment, CeyPay supports WooCommerce-based online stores. Merchants can get started quickly using our WooCommerce plugin, with other integrations planned for the future.
