## Legal & Compliance

    <Check>Licensed exchange partnerships</Check>
    <Check>No legal tender claims</Check>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will this complicate my accounting?" icon="calculator">
    No. You receive LKR and record it like a normal sale. Your accountant can follow regular bookkeeping.

    <Info>
      From an accounting perspective, CeyPay payments are identical to card or cash payments. You receive LKR, invoice in LKR, and report in LKR.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I offer refunds?" icon="rotate-left">
    Crypto payments are instant and final. Once a payment is completed on-chain, it cannot be reversed or double-spent. This means there are virtually no chargebacks, with over 99.9% of transactions being final.

    If a merchant chooses to issue a refund, it can be handled manually off-chain or through settlement adjustments, based on mutual agreement with the customer.

    <Warning>
      Unlike card payments, crypto transactions cannot be reversed. Refunds require manual processing through settlement adjustments.
    </Warning>

    <Check>Over 99.9% finality rate</Check>
    <Check>No chargeback fraud</Check>
    <Check>Reduced dispute risk</Check>
