## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Selects CeyPay">
    At checkout, the customer selects CeyPay as their payment method and clicks
    "Place Order".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Crypto Provider">
    A modal appears where the customer selects their preferred crypto wallet
    (Binance, Bybit, or Bitazza).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan QR Code">
    A QR code is generated for the selected provider. On mobile, a deep link
    button opens the wallet app directly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Confirmation">
    CeyPay monitors the payment status in real-time. Once confirmed, the order
    is automatically marked as complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## WordPress Plugin Endpoint

The CeyPay WordPress Plugin automatically creates a dedicated webhook endpoint for receiving payment notifications:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Webhook Endpoint
https://yoursite.com/?wc-api=WC_Gateway_CeyPay
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  This endpoint is automatically configured by the plugin. All payment
  confirmations from Binance Pay, Bybit, and Bitazza are securely delivered to
  this URL with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification.
</Tip>
