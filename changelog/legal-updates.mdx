<Update label="2026-02-13">
## Why Local Settlement Infrastructure Matters More Than Ever

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has clarified that transactions between residents within Sri Lanka must be conducted in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), unless specifically authorized.

This is an important reminder for merchants and the wider business community.

At CeyPay, our model is built around one core principle:

- All merchant settlements are conducted in LKR
- We do not facilitate resident-to-resident foreign currency transactions
- We do not convert LKR into foreign currency to credit local Foreign Currency Accounts

Our infrastructure focuses on enabling compliant digital asset inflows while ensuring that settlement within Sri Lanka remains LKR-based and aligned with existing regulatory frameworks.

As the ecosystem evolves, structured and compliant payment rails are not optional. They are necessary.

CeyPay is committed to building responsible, transparent infrastructure that supports merchants, protects users, and aligns with Sri Lanka's financial regulations.

The future of digital payments in Sri Lanka must be innovative, but it must also be compliant.
