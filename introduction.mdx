## What is CeyPay?

## Problems We Solve

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Crypto Acceptance Barrier" icon="lock">
    **The Problem**: Most merchants want to tap into the crypto market but are intimidated by wallets, private keys, and blockchain complexity. Setting up crypto payments traditionally requires technical expertise.

    **CeyPay's Solution**: Accept crypto without learning how it works. We handle all the technical complexity. You receive familiar LKR payments in your bank account, just like traditional payment gateways.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chargeback Fraud" icon="ban">
    **The Problem**: Credit card chargebacks cost merchants billions annually. Fraudulent disputes can reverse payments weeks or months after delivery, with merchants losing both product and payment.

    **CeyPay's Solution**: Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible. Once payment is confirmed, it's final. Eliminate chargeback fraud completely while accepting legitimate payments globally.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High Payment Processing Fees" icon="money-bill">
    **The Problem**: Traditional card rails charge 2-4% plus gateway fees, currency conversion costs, and international transaction fees. These costs eat into profit margins, especially for cross-border sales.

    **CeyPay's Solution**: Simple, low fee per transaction with no hidden charges. No setup fees, no monthly minimums. Pay only for successful transactions.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Global Payment Restrictions" icon="globe">
    **The Problem**: Traditional payment processors have geographic limitations, currency restrictions, and banking downtime. International payments face delays and high conversion fees.

    **CeyPay's Solution**: Accept borderless payments 24/7 from anywhere in the world. No currency restrictions, no banking hours, no weekend delays. Settlement within 24 hours or next business day.
