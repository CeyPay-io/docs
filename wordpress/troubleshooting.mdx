This guide covers the most common issues you might encounter when using CeyPay and how to resolve them.

## Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CeyPay not showing in payment methods">
    **Symptoms:** After installation, CeyPay doesn't appear in WooCommerce > Settings > Payments.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure WooCommerce is installed and activated
    2. Check that CeyPay plugin is activated in Plugins > Installed Plugins
    3. Clear any caching plugins or server cache
    4. Verify PHP version is 7.4 or higher in Tools > Site Health

    ```php
    // Check PHP version
    phpinfo(); // Should show PHP 7.4+
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plugin activation error">
    **Symptoms:** Error message when trying to activate the plugin.

    **Common causes:**
    - PHP version too low (requires 7.4+)
    - WooCommerce not active
    - File permissions issue

    **Solution:** Check the error message for specifics. Ensure all requirements are met before activating.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conflict with other plugins">
    **Symptoms:** Site crashes or behaves unexpectedly after installing CeyPay.

    **Solution:**
    1. Deactivate all plugins except WooCommerce and CeyPay
    2. Test if the issue persists
    3. Reactivate plugins one by one to identify the conflict
    4. Contact support with the conflicting plugin name
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Checkout Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CeyPay not visible at checkout">
    **Symptoms:** CeyPay doesn't appear as a payment option on the checkout page.

    **Possible causes:**
    1. **Gateway disabled** - Enable it in WooCommerce > Settings > Payments
    2. **Test Mode enabled** - Only admins see CeyPay in test mode; log in as admin
    3. **Missing credentials** - Configure Merchant ID and Webhook Secret
    4. **Currency not supported** - Verify your store currency is supported

    **Quick check:**
    - Look for "Action Needed" badge next to CeyPay in payment settings
    - Review the admin notice at the top of WordPress admin pages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Payment modal not opening">
    **Symptoms:** Clicking "Place Order" doesn't open the payment modal.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12 > Console)
    2. Ensure jQuery is loaded (required by WooCommerce)
    3. Try a different browser or incognito mode
    4. Disable other JavaScript-heavy plugins temporarily
    5. Check if a page builder is interfering with checkout

    **Console command to verify:**
    ```javascript
    // Check if CeyPay scripts are loaded
    console.log(typeof ceypay_params);
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="QR code not generating">
    **Symptoms:** Provider selection works, but no QR code appears.

    **Causes:**
    - API connection failure
    - Invalid Merchant ID
    - Server cannot make outbound HTTPS requests

    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify your Merchant ID is correct
    2. Check if your server can reach external APIs
    3. Review WooCommerce logs for API errors
    4. Contact support if the issue persists
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: Invalid parameters">
    **Symptoms:** Error message about invalid parameters when generating QR code.

    **Solution:** This usually indicates missing order data. Ensure:
    - All required checkout fields are filled
    - The cart contains valid products
    - The currency is supported
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Webhook Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Orders stuck on 'Pending Payment'">
    **Symptoms:** Customer completes payment, but order status doesn't update.

    **Causes:**
    1. Webhooks not reaching your server
    2. Signature verification failing
    3. Site not publicly accessible

    **Diagnostic steps:**
    1. Check WooCommerce logs for webhook entries
    2. Verify your site is accessible from the internet
    3. Ensure SSL certificate is valid
    4. Confirm webhook secret matches exactly

    **Temporary workaround:** The plugin includes status polling, so the customer should see success if they keep the modal open. The webhook will update the order for admin visibility.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook signature mismatch">
    **Symptoms:** Logs show "Webhook signature mismatch" errors.

    **Solution:**
    1. Copy the Webhook Secret directly from your CeyPay dashboard
    2. Paste it into CeyPay settings without any extra spaces
    3. Save settings and test again

    <Warning>
      The webhook secret is case-sensitive. Copy it exactly as shown.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhooks not received at all">
    **Symptoms:** No webhook entries in logs, even after successful test payments.

    **Checklist:**
    - [ ] Site has valid SSL certificate (HTTPS required)
    - [ ] Site is not on localhost (use ngrok for local testing)
    - [ ] Firewall allows incoming POST requests
    - [ ] .htaccess or server config doesn't block the API endpoint
    - [ ] The webhook URL is correctly registered in CeyPay dashboard

    **Test your endpoint:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://yoursite.com/?wc-api=WC_Gateway_CeyPay
    # Should return 400 (Bad Request) - this means the endpoint is reachable
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Order Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate orders">
    **Symptoms:** Multiple orders created for a single payment.

    **Cause:** Customer clicking "Place Order" multiple times.

    **Solutions:**
    1. The plugin should prevent this, but if it occurs:
    2. Check for JavaScript errors that might prevent modal from opening
    3. Ensure the checkout page doesn't have duplicate form submissions
    4. Review any caching plugin settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Order marked as paid but payment not received">
    **Symptoms:** Order shows as Processing, but no payment in crypto wallet.

    **Cause:** This should only happen in Test Mode with simulated payments.

    **Solution:**
    1. Verify Test Mode is disabled for production
    2. Check that production Merchant ID is configured
    3. Review CeyPay dashboard for transaction records
    4. Contact CeyPay support with order details
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong amount shown">
    **Symptoms:** The payment amount in the modal doesn't match the order total.

    **Cause:** Currency conversion or rounding issues.

    **Solution:**
    1. Verify your store currency settings
    2. Check if any plugins modify order totals
    3. The USDT amount may differ due to exchange rates
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## WooCommerce Blocks Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CeyPay not working with Blocks checkout">
    **Symptoms:** CeyPay appears but doesn't function correctly with the Checkout Block.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure WooCommerce Blocks is up to date
    2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
    3. Verify the Checkout Block is properly configured
    4. Try switching to classic checkout temporarily to isolate the issue
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Modal styling broken in Blocks">
    **Symptoms:** Payment modal appears but looks broken or unstyled.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Clear all caches (page cache, browser cache, CDN cache)
    2. Check if your theme overrides WooCommerce styles
    3. Ensure CeyPay CSS file is loading (check Network tab in dev tools)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Mobile Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deep link not opening wallet app">
    **Symptoms:** Clicking the app button on mobile doesn't open the crypto wallet.

    **Causes:**
    - Wallet app not installed
    - Deep link not supported by browser
    - Browser blocking the redirect

    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure the customer has the relevant wallet app installed
    2. Try opening the link in the default mobile browser
    3. The QR code remains available as a fallback
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Modal too small on mobile">
    **Symptoms:** Payment modal is difficult to use on mobile devices.

    **Solution:** The modal should be responsive by default. If issues occur:
    1. Check if your theme has mobile-specific CSS that conflicts
    2. Disable any mobile optimization plugins temporarily
    3. Test in a default WordPress theme (like Storefront)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
