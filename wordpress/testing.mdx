description: How to test your CeyPay WordPress Plugin integration before accepting real payments.
---

Thoroughly testing your payment integration is essential before going live. CeyPay provides a built-in Test Mode that simulates the entire payment flow without processing real cryptocurrency transactions.

## Enabling Test Mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Settings">
    Navigate to **WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > CeyPay** in your WordPress admin.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Test Mode">
    Check the box labeled **Enable Test Mode**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save changes** at the bottom of the page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  When Test Mode is enabled, only logged-in administrators can see and use the CeyPay payment option. Regular customers will not see it at checkout.
</Info>

## Testing the Payment Flow

### Complete Test Transaction

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Products to Cart">
    Browse your store as an administrator and add one or more products to your cart.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Proceed to Checkout">
    Go to the checkout page and fill in the required billing details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select CeyPay">
    Choose **CeyPay** as your payment method. You should see the CeyPay logo and description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Place Order">
    Click **Place Order** to initiate the payment process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Provider">
    In the modal that appears, select a crypto provider:

    <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '20px', margin: '15px 0', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
      <img src="/images/binance.svg" alt="Binance Pay" style={{ height: '28px' }} />
      <img src="/images/bybit.svg" alt="Bybit" style={{ height: '28px' }} />
      <img src="/images/bitazza.svg" alt="Bitazza" style={{ height: '28px' }} />
    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View QR Code">
    A QR code will be generated. In Test Mode, you'll also see a **"Simulate Success (Test Mode)"** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulate Payment">
    Click the simulation button to complete the test payment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Completion">
    You should be redirected to the Order Received page, and the order status should change to "Processing".
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What to Verify

Use this checklist to ensure your integration is working correctly:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Checkout Display">
    - [ ] CeyPay appears in the payment methods list
    - [ ] Logo displays correctly (both light and dark themes if applicable)
    - [ ] Description text is visible
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Payment Modal">
    - [ ] Modal opens after clicking "Place Order"
    - [ ] All three providers are displayed (Binance, Bybit, Bitazza)
    - [ ] Provider selection works correctly
    - [ ] QR code loads after selecting a provider
    - [ ] "Simulate Success" button appears in Test Mode
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Order Processing">
    - [ ] Order is created with "Pending Payment" status initially
    - [ ] Order transitions to "Processing" after simulated payment
    - [ ] Order notes show payment confirmation
    - [ ] Customer receives order confirmation email
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mobile Experience">
    - [ ] Modal is responsive on mobile devices
    - [ ] Deep link button appears for mobile users
    - [ ] QR code is scannable on smaller screens
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Testing Webhooks

While Test Mode simulates immediate payment confirmation, you should also verify that webhooks work correctly.

### Check Webhook Logs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable WooCommerce Logging">
    Go to **WooCommerce > Status > Logs** to access the log files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find CeyPay Logs">
    Look for log files prefixed with `ceypay-`. These contain debug information about webhook processing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Entries">
    Check for successful webhook receipts and any error messages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Webhook Testing Tools

For more thorough webhook testing, you can use tools like:

- **ngrok** - Create a public URL for your local development environment
- **Webhook.site** - Inspect incoming webhook payloads
- **RequestBin** - Debug webhook requests

<Warning>
  These tools are for development/testing only. Never expose your production webhook secret or use these tools on a live store.
</Warning>

## Testing WooCommerce Blocks

If your store uses the WooCommerce Blocks checkout:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Block Checkout">
    Ensure your checkout page uses the Checkout Block rather than the shortcode-based checkout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Payment Flow">
    Follow the same testing steps as above. The CeyPay payment option should integrate seamlessly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Console">
    Open browser developer tools and check for any JavaScript errors during checkout.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Edge Cases

### Payment Expiration

To test expired payments:

1. Start a test payment but don't click "Simulate Success"
2. Wait for the payment to expire (or close the modal)
3. Verify the order remains in "Pending Payment" status

### Failed Payments

Failed payments can be simulated by:

1. Using invalid test data (if supported by the test API)
2. Manually updating order status to "Failed" in WooCommerce admin
3. Checking that appropriate error messages display

### Multiple Payments

Test scenarios with:

- Multiple items in cart
- Various currencies (if your store supports them)
- Different customer billing information
