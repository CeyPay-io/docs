</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Payment Settings" icon="gear">
    Navigate to **WooCommerce → Settings → Payments** in your WordPress admin dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable CeyPay" icon="toggle-on">

</Check>

## Get Your API Credentials

<Tip>
  Don't have a CeyPay account yet? You can apply for a merchant account in
  minutes and get instant access to test mode credentials.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a CeyPay Account" icon="user-plus">
    Visit [merchant.ceypay.io](https://merchant.ceypay.io) and sign up for a
    merchant account. You'll receive test credentials immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Verification" icon="id-card">
    Complete the merchant verification process to unlock production access and
    real payment processing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access API Settings" icon="key">
    In your CeyPay dashboard, navigate to **Settings → API Settings** or
    **Integration** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Credentials" icon="copy">
    Copy your **Merchant ID** and **Webhook Secret**. Keep these secure—they're
    used to authenticate API requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Your webhook secret should be treated like a password. Never share it publicly
  or commit it to version control.
</Note>

## Verify Your Setup

<Tip>
  Always test your integration before going live. Test mode lets you simulate
  the complete payment flow without processing real transactions.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Test Mode" icon="flask">
    In the CeyPay settings (WooCommerce → Settings → Payments → CeyPay), check
    **Enable Test Mode**. This allows you to test without real transactions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Place a Test Order" icon="cart-plus">
    Add a product to your cart and proceed to checkout. Select **CeyPay** as the
    payment method.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the Flow" icon="mobile">
    After clicking "Place Order", the payment modal should appear with QR codes
    for Bybit, Binance Pay, and KuCoin. In test mode, you'll see a **"Simulate
    Success"** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Order Status" icon="circle-check">
    Click the simulate button and confirm the order is marked as
    **"Processing"** or **"Completed"** in WooCommerce → Orders.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Remember to disable Test Mode before accepting real payments!** Test Mode is
  only visible to administrators and prevents actual payment processing.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if the payment modal doesn't appear?" icon="circle-question">
    Check that:
    - JavaScript is enabled in your browser
    - Your theme is not blocking modal overlays
    - There are no JavaScript errors in the browser console (F12 → Console)
    - The plugin is activated and WooCommerce is working properly
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I test with real crypto wallets?" icon="wallet">
  Test mode simulates the payment flow without requiring real wallets. To test
  with actual Bybit, Binance Pay, or KuCoin accounts, disable test mode and use
  small amounts. Make sure you're in a test environment before processing real
  payments.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens after a successful test?" icon="check">
    A successful test confirms that:
    - The plugin is installed and activated correctly
    - Your API credentials are valid
    - Webhooks are configured properly (if using real mode)
    - WooCommerce can process orders through CeyPay

    You're ready to accept real crypto payments!
